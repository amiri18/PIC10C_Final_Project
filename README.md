# Final Project: Checkers Game!
This is a one player checkers game against the computer that is **displayed on the console**. The game will display the instructions and ask the user to enter in their move, since it is their turn first. Afterward the computer will make its move. The game continues until either the user quits or someone wins.

## Players:
- The computer is `Player X` and the user is `Player O`.

## Rules:
- X and O pieces can only move in their respective forward diagonal direction.
- If a piece of Player X  makes it to the other side, their piece will get *kinged*, and the X becomes a K. Similarily if a piece of the user's makes it the other side, their piece will get *queened*, and the O becomes an Q. "Royal" pieces, unlike regular ones, can move fowards AND backwards.
- For a player to "kill" their opponent, they can either single or double jump their piece. *The user's goal is to kill all of the computer's piece's.*
